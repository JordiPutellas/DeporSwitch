Privacy Policy for DeporSwitch
DeporSwitch is a Chrome extension designed for Deporvillage employees. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.

1. Information We Collect
   DeporSwitch does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data from its users. All processing occurs locally on the user's device. Specifically, the extension performs the following operations:

Accessing Active Tab Information: The extension reads the URL and SKU of the product on the active tab to generate corresponding URLs for other Deporvillage domains.
Creating and Updating Tabs: The extension may open new tabs or update existing tabs with the generated URLs. 2. How We Use Information
As DeporSwitch does not collect any personal information, there is no usage of such data. The extension's functionalities are limited to:

Extracting SKU information from the active tab.
Generating URLs for different Deporvillage domains.
Copying URLs to the clipboard.
Opening or updating browser tabs with the generated URLs. 3. Third-Party Services
DeporSwitch does not use any third-party services to collect, store, or process user data. All operations are performed locally within the browser extension.

4. Data Security
   Since DeporSwitch does not collect or store any user data, there are no specific data security measures in place for protecting user data. The extension operates entirely within the user's browser, ensuring that no data is transmitted or exposed to external parties.

5. User Consent
   By using the DeporSwitch extension, users consent to the processing of their tab information strictly for the purposes described in this policy. Users can disable or remove the extension at any time through the Chrome Web Store or their browser settings.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
   We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and users are encouraged to review this policy periodically.
